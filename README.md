 Title-My first Portfolio.
           
               WHAT IT DOES.
This website will be my first attempt at making my very own Portfolio to show what skills i have developed so far into the course.

                WHY IT IS USEFUL.
It will also work as an anchor and milestone to remind myself where i came from in my developing journey.

                  TOOLS I WILL USE TO GET STARTED
I will be using html and css to build my website, namely Tailwind Css and some elements from Bootstrap as well possibly.    

                   QUERIES
